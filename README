This software is a 100% Python interface to the memcached memory cache
daemon.  It is the client side software which allows storing values in one
or more, possibly remote, memcached servers.  Search google for memcached
for more information.

This package was originally written by Evan Martin of Danga.
Please do not contact Evan about maintenance.
Sean Reifschneider of tummy.com, ltd. has taken over maintenance of it.

Note: this is only a branch of the original for the specific purpose of adding a flag_override
function to the original. This functionality is only useful is python-memcached is used together
with other memcached clients such as Java or PHP, which have their own definitions of what a flag
may mean. For example, python-memcached will flag Long Ints as 2, which PHP will interpret as 
compressed data. Neither of these is wrong (flags are undefined) but it means they cannot 
interoperate.I have no objection to this functionality being added to the base 
if it is found to be useful. 

Note: I have only tested the set functions, I have not tested the other implementations of set (prepend, append, multi, etc).
