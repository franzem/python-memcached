   * Alex Stapleton found that the sendall call was slow for writing data
   larger than several kilobytes.  I had him test a change to his patch,
   which worked as well, but was simpler.  The code now does two sendall
   calls, one for the data and one for the line termination, if the data is
   larger than 100 bytes.
